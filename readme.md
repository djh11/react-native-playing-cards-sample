# React Native Cards

This is a basic deck of cards compatible with React Native, built with create-react-native-app. 
It builds off of React card examples like those in https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-playing-card.
It includes the card images, a card class which maps the images to card name strings, and a deck context. 
There are also examples for consuming the context and using the card class in the examples folder.
